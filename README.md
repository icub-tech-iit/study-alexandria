==========

## üåø Repository structure
This repository is organized based upon the following branches:
- üîò [`master`](../../tree/master) contains the source code of the Alexandria Project

### üîΩ How to clone specific branches locally
```console
git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/study-alexandria.git
```

## Usage
‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under development ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Dependencies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)

### Installation

If you don't have Pythone installed yet, follow the instructions based on your OS.

- **Linux**

    Install Python via the system package manager:

    ```console
    sudo apt install python3
    ```

- **Linux/macOS/Windows**

    Alternatively, you can install a `conda` distribution and create a conda environment with Python:

    ```console
    conda create --name myenv python=3.x
    conda activate myenv
    ```

To install Python packages instead, [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) is typically used (if you want to avoid conflicts between package versions, please use a virtual environment).

```console
python3 -m venv alexandriaenv
source alexandriaenv/bin/activate
pip install lxml
```

### How it works

To generate the XML files for the robots listed in [**`general.json`**](./general.json), please run:

```console
python3 sysml2xml.py --config sysml
```

where `sysml` is the folder where the SysML templates are stored.

This script will create a folder for each of the listed robots, mirroring the architecture of [`robots-configuration`](https://github.com/robotology/robots-configuration).
